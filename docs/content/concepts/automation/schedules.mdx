# Schedules

Schedules are Dagster's way of supporting traditional methods of [automation](/concepts/automation), which allow you to specify when a [job](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) should run. Using schedules, you can define a fixed time interval to run a pipeline, such as daily, hourly, or Monday at 9:00 AM.

Each interval of a schedule is called a **tick**, which is an indication that a job should begin executing. Ticks kick off **runs**, which is a single instance of a job being executed.

When viewing a schedule in Dagster's UI, you can see the schedule's definition, executing timezone, targeted jobs and partitions, as well as its tick and run history.

## Benefits

Using schedules helps you:

- Predictably process and deliver data to stakeholders and business-critical applications
- Consistently run data pipelines without the need for manual intervention
- Optimize resource usage by scheduling pipelines to run during off-peak hours

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Cron syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
- [Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and [asset jobs](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs)
- [Ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) and [op jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-jobs) _(optional)_

## How it works

Schedules run jobs at fixed time intervals and have two main components:

- **A job**, which targets a selection of assets or ops
- [**A cron expression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), which defines when the schedule runs. Simple and complex schedules are supported, allowing you to have fine-grained control over when runs are executed. With cron syntax, you can:

  - **Create custom schedules** like `Every hour from 9:00AM - 5:00PM` with cron expressions (`0 9-17 * * *`)
  - **Quickly create basic schedules** like `Every day at midnight` with predefined cron definitions (`@daily`, `@midnight`)

  To make creating cron expressions easier, you can use an online tool like [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/). This tool allows you to create and describe cron expressions in a human-readable format and test the execution dates produced by the expression. **Note**: While this tool is useful for general cron expression testing, always remember to [test your schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules/testing) in Dagster to ensure the results are as expected.

Running a schedule requires the schedule to be turned on and an active [`dagster-daemon` process](/deployment/dagster-daemon). If you used [`dagster dev` to start the Dagster UI/webserver](/guides/running-dagster-locally), the daemon process will be automatically launched alongside the webserver.

After these criteria are met, the schedule will run at the interval specified in the cron expression. Schedules will execute in UTC by default, but [you can specify a custom timezone](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones).

Using schedules, you can:

- Automate the [materialization of assets](/concepts/automation/schedules/automating-assets-schedules-jobs) and [execution of ops](/concepts/automation/schedules/automating-ops-schedules-jobs)
- Construct schedules to run [partitioned jobs](/concepts/automation/schedules/partitioned-schedules)
- Execute jobs in [specific timezones](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones)

---

## Limitations and notes

- Dagster supports all [predefined cron definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Nonstandard_predefined_scheduling_definitions) with the exeception of `@reboot`
- When defining a schedule's execution time, keep [Daylight Savings Time (DST) in mind](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones#execution-times-and-daylight-savings-time)
